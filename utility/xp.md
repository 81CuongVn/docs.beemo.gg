# XP
Beemo's XP system allows for members to gain experience as they participate in the server via text & voice channels.

---

## About

Users are able to gain XP through both text and voice channels, with customisable curves and role rewards for levels. Servers can add roles to be rewarded at different level milestones and benefit from an intregrated XP leaderboard.

If enabled alongside XP, users will also gain Honey at the same rate, which is consumable in a Honey role shop. See https://docs.beemo.gg/utility/honey for more information on the Honey shop.

| xp keepxproles [yes/no] 	| `/xp keeproles yes` 	| Sets if users should keep their previous XP roles when they reach the next role reward. 	|
| xp resetonleave [yes/no] 	| `/xp resetonleave no` 	| Sets if user XP / honey should be reset upon leaving the server. 	|
| xp resetonban [yes/no] 	| `/xp resetonban yes` 	| Sets if user XP / honey should be reset upon being banned from the server. 	|
| xp notifications [yes/no] 	| `/xp notifications no` 	| Sets if a level up notification should be sent when a user levels up. 	|
| xp notificationschannel [channel name/id] 	| `/xp notificationschannel #notify` 	| Sets the channel to send level up notifications to. Put none for the channel name to remove a set channel. If no channel is specified, the notice will be sent to the user's DMs. 	|
| xp commandchannel [channel name/id] 	| `/xp commandchannel #bot-commands` 	| Adds or removes the specified text channel as an allowed channel for XP and honey commands. 	|
| xp commandchannels 	| - 	| Lists the current XP and honey command channels. 	|
| xp rankcommandcooldown [seconds] 	| `/xp rankcommandcooldown 5` 	| Sets the cooldown in seconds for the /rank command. 	|
| xp difficulty [new difficulty (decimal)] 	| `/xp difficulty 2.0` 	| Sets the difficulty of the XP system. This modifies the multiplier so that the amount of XP needed to reach the next level is either larger or smaller. IMPORTANT: This setting will change the XP curve, which will affect the current level of all users. 	|
| xp leveltoxpratio [new ratio (decimal)] | `/xp leveltoxpratio 1.5` | This modifies the exponent to the XP function, which changes the relation of XP gained to level achieved. The curve is determined by the formula: `XP = Difficulty * (Level)^(Level to XP Ratio) + 4`. For example, a difficulty of 1.2 and a level to xp ratio of 3.1 will result in a curve of `xp = 1.2 * level^3.1 + 4`, which means that it requires `xp` xp to be acquired in order to reach `level` level. |
