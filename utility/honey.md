## About Honey
Honey allows for servers to reward activity with credits they can later trade in for role-rewards. These credits, namely "Honey," are earned at the same rate as XP; This means that users can spend their Honey without affecting their XP level. There are many applications that could be be done with this system - for example, servers could allow for active users to claim exclusive colour roles.
