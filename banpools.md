# Banpools

Banpools allow for Beemo Max servers to group together and ban users across multiple servers with one command.

## How do Banpools work?

When servers join a banpool, they will recieve all bans from other servers in that banpool. All users by default are apart of the  `antispam` banpool, which serves to protect all participants against userbot raids.
